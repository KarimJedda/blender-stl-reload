# blender-stl-reload
A simple helper add-on to reload STL files from disk, whenever these change.

# Warning

For now you can consider this a hack I'm using to load & reload STL files from build123d scripts to get an overview of part assemblies. The file watchdog mechanism is not yet implemented but will follow shortly
Use at your own risk. 

# Features
